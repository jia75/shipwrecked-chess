# QuadChess

QuadChess is a 4 player chess game for the Shipwrecked badges. It works wirelessly (nice). 

# Installation

Either fork the repo and use ``mpremote`` or just install the zip with the web flasher. (To get the zip you can just use `make`)

# Usage

To start a game, a host has to create a lobby and other players have to join. The host can then start the game and all players can move using the ``SW8``, ``SW13``, ``SW4`` and ``SW10`` buttons. To select a piece and make your move, use the ``SW5`` button.
